# c_menu

A c library created by Taylor Bradley, formatted to the Barr-C standard to easily create a menu with multiple options.

## TODO

Currently, this library depends on another library, my `c_inputlib` library. This is needed to display the menu, but I plan to remove this dependency.

- [ ] Remove inputlib dependency by removing input handling in menu code.
